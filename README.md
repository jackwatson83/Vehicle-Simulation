# Vehicle Simulation
A simulation of vehicles in the Unity Game Engine to accompany my Masters Research Project:  Innovating Vehicle-to-Human Interfaces, inspired by Computer Games Design.

In this project, objects representing vehicles navigate a road loop, and react to each other as well as obstacles.
